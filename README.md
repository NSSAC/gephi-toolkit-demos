**Plot Graph**

This contains code to take graph files and produce a PDF visualization.
A comprehensive README is avaiable in the igraph folder that describes how to use plot_igraph.py to achieve this functionality.
In addition, on the wiki page of this repo, you can find some observations that I made about different graph vizualization libraries that I examined.
